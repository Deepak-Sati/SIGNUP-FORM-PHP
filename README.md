# SignUpForm-Validation-Server-PHP

Firstly you need to set-up a server which provides you with localhost

You could use any software for the same , I personally use XAMPP due to following reasons

1. Provides you with APACHE server(localhost)
2. Provides with PHPMYADMIN for reading/writing values into database.
3. Provides with SQL to implement queries on data of database.

To SETUP 

1. Download XAMPP
2. Create a .php file sign up form (html+php) for form validation
3. Create a .css file if you want to style your php file
4. Save both the files in the XAMPP/htdocs/dashboard/your_file

To RUN file on SERVER

1. Open localhost on google chrome
2. Redirects to localhost/dashboard/your_file.php
3. Opens your php/html file
